# Destini ðŸ¤”

## Abstract

Destini is a choose your own adventure game like [Bandersnatch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch). In this app, the story changes as the user wishes it to change. It starts with an initial story (say, Story 0) and the user has to choose from the 2 options given below. If the user chooses the first option, the story will revolve in that way. If he chooses the second option, the story changes. To make it more clear, have a look at [Destini Story Plan.](https://github.com/haardikdharma10/Destini/blob/master/Destini-Story-Plan.pdf)
